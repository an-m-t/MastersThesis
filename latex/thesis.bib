The methods used in the M-competition as well as the M3-competition, and many of the measures recommended by previous authors on this topic, are found to be degenerate in commonly occurring situations. Instead, we propose that the mean absolute scaled error become the standard measure for comparing forecast accuracy across multiple time series.}

abstract = {Dimensionality reduction is one of the fundamental and important topics in the fields of pattern recognition and machine learning. However, most existing dimensionality reduction methods aim to seek a projection matrix W such that the projection WTx is exactly equal to the true low-dimensional representation. In practice, this constraint is too rigid to well capture the geometric structure of data. To tackle this problem, we relax this constraint but use an elastic one on the projection with the aim to reveal the geometric structure of data. Based on this context, we propose an unsupervised dimensionality reduction model named flexible unsupervised feature extraction (FUFE) for image classification. Moreover, we theoretically prove that PCA and LPP, which are two of the most representative unsupervised dimensionality reduction models, are special cases of FUFE, and propose a non-iterative algorithm to solve it. Experiments on five real-world image databases show the effectiveness of the proposed model.}

In essence, ICA separates an observed set of signal mixtures into a set of statistically independent component signals, or source signals. In so doing, this powerful method can extract the relatively small amount of useful information typically found in large data sets. The applications for ICA range from speech processing, brain imaging, and electrical brain signals to telecommunications and stock predictions.In Independent Component Analysis, Jim Stone presents the essentials of ICA and related techniques (projection pursuit and complexity pursuit) in a tutorial style, using intuitive examples described in simple geometric terms. The treatment fills the need for a basic primer on ICA that can be used by readers of varying levels of mathematical sophistication, including engineers, cognitive scientists, and neuroscientists who need to know the essentials of this evolving method. An overview establishes the strategy implicit in ICA in terms of its essentially physical underpinnings and describes how ICA is based on the key observations that different physical processes generate outputs that are statistically independent of each other. The book then describes what Stone calls "the mathematical nuts and bolts" of how ICA works. Presenting only essential mathematical proofs, Stone guides the reader through an exploration of the fundamental characteristics of ICA. Topics covered include the geometry of mixing and unmixing; methods for blind source separation; and applications of ICA, including voice mixtures, EEG, fMRI, and fetal heart monitoring. The appendixes provide a vector matrix tutorial, plus basic demonstration computer code that allows the reader to see how each mathematical method described in the text translates into working Matlab computer code.}",

Theoretical results indicate that the method preserves distances quite nicely; however, empirical results are sparse. We present experimental results on using random projection as a dimensionality reduction tool in a number of cases, where the high dimensionality of the data would otherwise lead to burden-some computations. Our application areas are the processing of both noisy and noiseless images, and information retrieval in text documents. We show that projecting the data onto a random lower-dimensional subspace yields results comparable to conventional dimensionality reduction methods such as principal component analysis: the similarity of data vectors is preserved well under random projection. However, using random projections is computationally significantly less expensive than using, e.g., principal component analysis. We also show experimentally that using a sparse random matrix gives additional computational savings in random projection.},

abstract = {In this paper a local manifold learning method based on the local distances preserving (LDP) is proposed. LDP focuses on extracting and preserving the local distances between the data points. In LDP, the coefficients between each data point and its neighbors are calculated based on the inverse of Euclidean distances between them. Then, a minimization function, which is in accordance with the calculated coefficients, is proposed for calculating the embedded data manifold in the low-dimensional representation space. Matching the way of calculation the coefficients and the proposed minimization function is the main significance of the proposed LDP method. In addition, the proposed LDP method shows less sensitivity to the initial parameters such as the number of neighbors and the value of variance. Also, a stochastic based extension of LDP (SLDP) manifold learning method is proposed. The proposed method is compared with the common manifold learning methods based on the achievable recognition rate and the power of the local distances preserving. The experiments have been done on two different kinds of databases: HODA Persian handwritten character database and ORL face image database. The results demonstrate the suitable performance of LDP and SLDP. Also, the results show the robustness of the proposed method to the number of neighbors and the value of variance parameter. Moreover, the proposed method of calculating the embedded data points in LDP and SLDP has less complexity than the similar local manifold learning methods, Laplacian eigenmaps (LEM) and stochastic LEM (SLEM).}

abstract = {Dynamic time warping (DTW), which finds the minimum path by providing non-linear alignments between two time series, has been widely used as a distance measure for time series classification and clustering. However, DTW does not account for the relative importance regarding the phase difference between a reference point and a testing point. This may lead to misclassification especially in applications where the shape similarity between two sequences is a major consideration for an accurate recognition. Therefore, we propose a novel distance measure, called a weighted DTW (WDTW), which is a penalty-based DTW. Our approach penalizes points with higher phase difference between a reference point and a testing point in order to prevent minimum distance distortion caused by outliers. The rationale underlying the proposed distance measure is demonstrated with some illustrative examples. A new weight function, called the modified logistic weight function (MLWF), is also proposed to systematically assign weights as a function of the phase difference between a reference point and a testing point. By applying different weights to adjacent points, the proposed algorithm can enhance the detection of similarity between two time series. We show that some popular distance measures such as DTW and Euclidean distance are special cases of our proposed WDTW measure. We extend the proposed idea to other variants of DTW such as derivative dynamic time warping (DDTW) and propose the weighted version of DDTW. We have compared the performances of our proposed procedures with other popular approaches using public data sets available through the UCR Time Series Data Mining Archive for both time series classification and clustering problems. The experimental results indicate that the proposed approaches can achieve improved accuracy for time series classification and clustering problems.}

In particular, we show that: (1) there always exists a linear mapping from the high-dimensional space to the low-dimensional space such that all the constraint conditions in the LLE can be satisfied. The implication of the existence of such a linear mapping is that the LLE cannot guarantee a one-to-one mapping from the high-dimensional space to the low-dimensional space for a given data set; (2) if the LLE is required to globally preserve distance, it must be a PCA mapping; (3) for a given high-dimensional data set, there always exists a local distance-preserving LLE. The above results can bring some new insights into a better understanding of the LLE.}

This paper explores the ways discrete data can be incorporated into PCA. The effects of discreteness of the observed variables on the PCA are reviewed. The statistical properties of the popular Filmer and Pritchett (2001) procedure are analyzed. The concepts of polychoric and polyserial correlations are introduced with appropriate references to the existing literature demonstrating their statistical properties. A large simulation study is carried out to compare various implementations of discrete data PCA. The simulation results show that the currently used method of running PCA on a set of dummy variables as proposed by Filmer and Pritchett (2001) can be improved upon by using procedures appropriate for discrete data, such as retaining the ordinal variables without breaking them into a set of dummy variables or using polychoric correlations. An empirical example using Bangladesh 2000 Demographic and Health Survey data helps in explaining the differences between procedures.},

We study the scenario where the observations are drawn from non-i.i.d. processes (m-dependency or a more general Ï•-mixing case). We show that COCA can allow weak dependence. In particular, we provide the generalization bounds of convergence for both support recovery and parameter estimation of COCA for the dependent data. We provide explicit sufficient conditions on the degree of dependence, under which the parametric rate can be maintained. To our knowledge, this is the first work analyzing the theoretical performance of PCA for the dependent data in high dimensional settings. Our results strictly generalize the analysis in Han \& Liu (2012) and the techniques we used have the separate interest for analyzing a variety of other multivariate statistical methods.},

One tension that has always faced these methods is the trade-off between preservation of global structure and preservation of local structure: these methods can either handle one or the other, but not both. In this work, our main goal is to understand what aspects of DR methods are important for preserving both local and global structure: it is difficult to design a better method without a true understanding of the choices we make in our algorithms and their empirical impact on the low-dimensional embeddings they produce. Towards the goal of local structure preservation, we provide several useful design principles for DR loss functions based on our new understanding of the mechanisms behind successful DR methods. Towards the goal of global structure preservation, our analysis illuminates that the choice of which components to preserve is important. We leverage these insights to design a new algorithm for DR, called Pairwise Controlled Manifold Approximation Projection (PaCMAP), which preserves both local and global structure. Our work provides several unexpected insights into what design choices both to make and avoid when constructing DR algorithms.},

abstract = {Dimensionality reduction has many applications in data visualization and machine learning. Existing methods can be classified into global ones and local ones. The global methods usually learn the linear relationship in data, while the local ones learn the manifold intrinsic geometry structure, which has a significant impact on pattern recognition. However, most of existing local methods obtain an embedding with eigenvalue or singular value decomposition, where the computational complexities are very high in a large amount of high-dimensional data. In this paper, we propose a local nonlinear dimensionality reduction method named Vec2vec, which employs a neural network with only one hidden layer to reduce the computational complexity. We first build a neighborhood similarity graph from the input matrix, and then define the context of data points with the random walk properties in the graph. Finally, we train the neural network with the context of data points to learn the embedding of the matrix. We conduct extensive experiments of data classification and clustering on nine image and text datasets to evaluate the performance of our method. Experimental results show that Vec2vec is better than several state-of-the-art dimensionality reduction methods, except that it is equivalent to UMAP on data clustering tasks in the statistical hypothesis tests, but Vec2vec needs less computational time than UMAP in high-dimensional data. Furthermore, we propose a more lightweight method named Approximate Vec2vec (AVec2vec) with little performance degradation, which employs an approximate method to build the neighborhood similarity graph. AVec2vec is still better than some state-of-the-art local dimensionality reduction methods and competitive with UMAP on data classification and clustering tasks in the statistical hypothesis tests.}

In addition to the content of news stories, their presentation can also be made misleading or biased. In this work, we study the impact of the ordering of news stories on audience perception. We introduce the problems of detecting cherry-picked news orderings and maximizing neutrality in news orderings. We prove hardness results and present several algorithms for approximately solving these problems. Furthermore, we provide extensive experimental results and present evidence of potential cherry-picking in the real world.},

It is based on a Markov-chain model of random walk through the graph. The model assigns transition probabilities to the links between nodes, so that a random walker can jump from node to node. A quantity, called the average commute time, computes the average time taken by a random walker for reaching node j for the first time when starting from node i, and coming back to node i. The square root of this quantity, the ECTD, is a distance measure between any two nodes, and has the nice property of decreasing when the number of paths connecting two nodes increases and when the ``length'' of any path decreases. The ECTD can be computed from the pseudoinverse of the Laplacian matrix of the graph, which is a kernel. We finally define the Principal Components Analysis (PCA) of a graph as the subspace projection that preserves as much variance as possible, in terms of the ECTD. This graph PCA has some interesting links with spectral graph theory, in particular spectral clustering.",

We selected the lysine-, arginine-, ornithine-binding protein (LAO) as a target protein and focused on its domain motions in the open state. A MD simulation of the LAO in explicit water was performed for 600 ns, in which slow and large-amplitude domain motions of the LAO were observed. After extracting domain motions by rigid-body domain analysis, the tICA was applied to the obtained rigid-body trajectory, yielding slow modes of the LAOâ€™s domain motions in order of decreasing time scale. The slowest mode detected by the tICA represented not a closure motion described by a largest-amplitude mode determined by the principal component analysis but a twist motion with a time scale of tens of nanoseconds. The slow dynamics of the LAO were well described by only the slowest mode and were characterized by transitions between two basins. The results show that tICA is promising for describing and analyzing slow dynamics of proteins.}",

ABSTRACT = {Feature construction is critical in data-driven remaining useful life (RUL) prediction of machinery systems, and most previous studies have attempted to find a best single-filter method. However, there is no best single filter that is appropriate for all machinery systems. In this work, we devise a straightforward but efficient approach for RUL prediction by combining multiple filters and then reducing the dimension through principal component analysis. We apply multilayer perceptron and random forest methods to learn the underlying model. We compare our approach with traditional single-filtering approaches using two benchmark datasets. The former approach is significantly better than the latter in terms of a scoring function with a penalty for late prediction. In particular, we note that selecting a best single filter over the training set is not efficient because of overfitting. Taken together, we validate that our multiple filters-based approach can be a robust solution for RUL prediction of various machinery systems.},

We prove the linear time and space complexity of FastDTW both theoretically and empirically. We also analyze the accuracy of FastDTW by comparing it to two other types of existing approximate DTW algorithms: constraints (such as Sakoe-Chiba Bands) and abstraction.

Word vectors intuitively represent the average context in which a given word tends to occur, but they cannot explicitly model the diversity of these contexts. Although region representations of word meaning offer a natural alternative to word vectors, only few methods have been proposed that can effectively learn word regions. In this paper, we propose a new word embedding model which is based on SVM regression. We show that the underlying ranking interpretation of word contexts is sufficient to match, and sometimes outperform, the performance of popular methods such as Skip-gram. Furthermore, we show that by using a quadratic kernel, we can effectively learn word regions, which outperform existing unsupervised models for the task of hypernym detection.",
